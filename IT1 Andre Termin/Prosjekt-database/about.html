          <h3>Without healthy oceans, we cannot survive.</h3>
          <p>From the air we breathe, to the food we eat, to the
            climate we live in, we all depend on our oceans. Today,
            they are more important than ever. Healthy oceans absorb
            carbon from the atmosphere and help reduce the impact of
            climate change.</p>

Loggerheads are popular in the Mediterranean regions and are endangered due to tourism development overtaking their nesting spaces. Also, fishing nets and lines catch and tangle the hapless turtles.

Coral provides protection and shelter to small sea creatures and barrier reefs buffer the shores by reducing the size of waves. Coral is endangered due to ocean acidification and commercial fishing. Also, humans touching or standing on the reefs while snorkeling or diving damages them further.
