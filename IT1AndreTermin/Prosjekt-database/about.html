          <h3>Without healthy oceans, we cannot survive.</h3>
          <p>From the air we breathe, to the food we eat, to the
            climate we live in, we all depend on our oceans. Today,
            they are more important than ever. Healthy oceans absorb
            carbon from the atmosphere and help reduce the impact of
            climate change.</p>

            <h2>2009</h2>
            We started this organization in 2009 after realising
            how much of the marine wildlife is threatened. Our first act was to
             have our first ship embark on an expedition to the Guadelupe Island
             in Mexico. We later returned in 2010.</li>
          <li>
            <h2>2012</h2>
            2012 began with television. National Geographic follows
            one of our teams. This team traveled to South Africa in order to try
            and tag as many Gret White sharks in 50 days as possible. It was a
            succesfull expedtions as we managed to tag 40 sharks.</li>
          <li>
            <h2>2015</h2>
            This year we sat out for two expeditions; both in
            Australia. The hope of these two were to try and tag as many turtles,
            dolphins and tiger sharks that we could find.</li>
          <li>
            <h2>2016</h2>
            The year of 2016 brought many happy events for us here
            in StF. We managed to safeguard an entire beach so that the turtles
            could hatch in peace. In addition to this, we found and confirmed a
            shark nursery at Long Island. </li>
          <li>
            <h2>2019</h2>
            Today, it is 10 years since we started this mission
            and we are celebrating it with the knowledge that Norways labour
            pary recently voted for protecting vulnerable areas like Lofoten,
            Senja and Vesteraasen.</li>
